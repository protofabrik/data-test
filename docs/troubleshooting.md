"# Troubleshooting installation\n\nIf you have trouble installing `better-sqlite3`, follow this checklist:\n\n1. Make sure you're using nodejs v10.20.1 or later\n\n2. Make sure you have [`node-gyp`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) globally installed, including all of [its dependencies](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-unix). On Windows you may need to [configure some things manually](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows).\n\n3. If you're using [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), try running [`electron-rebuild`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-rebuild)\n\n4. If you're using Windows, follow these steps. Do them **in this order**, and **don't skip steps**.\n\n    1. Install the **latest** of node 10 or node 12.\n    2. Start an Admin PowerShell: Right-click the start icon, then pick `Windows PowerShell (Admin)`\n    3. Install *both* vs2015 and vs2017 libraries. Each line will take ~5-10 minutes.\n       ```sh\n       npm install --global --production --vs2015 --add-python-to-path windows-build-tools\n       npm install --global --production --add-python-to-path windows-build-tools node-gyp\n       ```\n    4. In your project, make sure you're not fighting with old build configurations. Delete **both**\n       * your `%USERPROFILE%/.node-gyp` and\n       * your project's `node_modules` directories.\n    5. Set up `%USERPROFILE%/.npmrc` correctly:\n       ```sh\n       msvs_version=2015\n       python=python2.7\n       ```\n       (where `%USERPROFILE%` is your home directory).\n    6. Run `npm install`\n\nIf none of these solved your problem, try browsing [previous issues](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3/issues?q=is%3Aissue) or open a [new issue](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3/issues/new).\n"
